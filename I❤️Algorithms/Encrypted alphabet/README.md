## Encrypt || Decrypt a message ##

The goal of this algorithm is to create two text areas. One of them will contain the original message. The other the encrypted result message. The app has two push buttons that will encrypt/decrypt the message.

The message will be encrypted acording to the following transformation:
```
var plainAlphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz:()!¡,'";
var encryptedAlphabet = "qw,ert(yuio'pa:sdfg!hjklz¡xcv)bnm";
```

This way, once you introduce a text in the first text area and click button "encrypt" the message will appear encrypted in the other text area, obyeing to the transformation applied above. Push the button "Decrypt" to decrypt any message previously encrypted.

#### Could you decrypt the following message? ####

```
