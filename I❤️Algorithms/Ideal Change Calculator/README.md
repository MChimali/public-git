## Calculator that provides the optimal change of notes and Coins ##

The goal is to implement an algorithm that returns the optimal change given an amount of money and the quantity of money given by the client.

The app must provide with:

* Input to introduce total price.
* Input to introduce money given by the client.
* Button to calculate the optimal change.
* Once the button is pressed, the app must show optimal change in the console.

In the shop we can give notes of 5 €, 10 €, 20 €, 50 €, 100 € y 200 €. We also can give coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 y 50 cents and coins of 1 and 2 euros.

As a result, if we provide a total price of 152 euros and the client is giving us 200 euros console must show:

* 2 notes of 20 euros.
* 1 note of 5 euros.
* 1 coin of 2 euros.
* 1 coin of 1 euro.
