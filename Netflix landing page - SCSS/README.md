## SCSS - Netflix landing page 🔥

Isn't that cool? The following folder contains the style needed to achieve the appearance for the Netflix landing page.

As the implementation bundle is so simple (only require SASS) we are going to bundle it with parcel.

To run it, you must have parcel installed globaly. If you do not have it:

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

To generate bundle using parcel:

```
parcel index.html
```
